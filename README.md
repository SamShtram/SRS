This is the Shelter Recognition System, IN the event of a weather emergency all you have to do is open the app and input your location to retrieve the 10 closest shelters to you

HOW TO RUN:

CLONE THE REPOSITORY USING GITHUB VIRTUAL DESKTOP OR ANY TYPE OF COMMAND LINE INTERFACE. We used gitbash for this.
ONCE CLONED, connect to the repo, then you must run ----  pip install -r "requirements.txt" so that you can have all the necessary modules downloaded for the app to run properly
once requirements are pip installed you can run app pipeline by running ---- run_app.py
this will load the backend, frontend and will launch the website on a secure local host
Once the site is open, all you must do is hit the use my location button or input any city or address. this will return the nearest shelters with an option to get directions to the shelter.
The use my location button is a little flawed because it uses ip addresses to get the geolocation of the user.
We hope this app helps in times of need.
